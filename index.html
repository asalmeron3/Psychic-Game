If I use the random method, multiply by 25, and round down (floor method), I should be able to always obtain an index bewteen 0 and 25. After making it to the end, I realized the computer would change its guess unless, I told it otherwise. I only want the computer to change its choice when the player has a total of 9 guess remaining: this means the user is starting brand new game or has lost but is going to keep playing more rounds.}r
