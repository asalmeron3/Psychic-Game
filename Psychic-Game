###Psychic-Game Markdown

1. Make a game where the computer randomly selects a letter and the user tries to guess that letter

2. The game should display

	a. # of Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
	b. # of Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
	c. # of Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
	d. All of the player's Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

3. When the player wins, increase the Wins counter by 1 and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).

4. When the player loses, increase the Losses counter by 1 and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
